# TPtr â€“ Lightweight Smart Pointer and Smart Array for C++ (No STL)

`TPtr` is a lightweight and safe smart pointer implementation for C++ that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation for both single objects and arrays â€” all without using the STL. It supports:

- Single objects (`new T`)
- Arrays (`new T[size]`)
- Arrays of pointers (`new T*[size]` with elements allocated via `new T`)
- Reference counting for safe pointer sharing
- Automatic deletion based on the type of object
- Compatible with embedded systems, SDKs, game engines, or legacy environments

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Replaces raw `new` / `delete` with automatic memory management
- âœ… Manual reference counting (like `shared_ptr`)
- âœ… Type-safe deletion for objects, arrays, and pointer arrays
- âœ… Zero STL usage â€“ ideal for environments with restricted C++ features
- âœ… Lightweight custom exception system (`TPtrOutOfRangeException`)
- âœ… Header-only design (`TPtr.h`) â€“ easy to include and use

## ðŸ“¦ Usage Examples

### Single Object

```cpp
TPtr<MyClass> obj;
obj.New(); // Allocates with new MyClass
obj->doSomething();
